# Crafting Material Logic

### School for Poetic Computation, Spring 2018

In order to translate experiences and concepts between radically different modalities —or— to engineer pieces that work with the physical world, we must understand our subject deeply.

## Outline

This course explores our relationship with the material world, from the very personal: how we pay attention, to observing the tolerances of a material/system to find exploitable patterns. Students will be introduced to new design tools like origami- the manipulation of the 2D manifold itself, and weaving- as a historical reflection on computation.
