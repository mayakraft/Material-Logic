# Crafting Material Logic

### School for Poetic Computation, Spring 2018

## Outline

*In order to translate experiences and concepts between radically different modalities —or— to engineer pieces that work with the physical world, we must understand our subject deeply.*

This course explores our relationship with the material world, from the very personal: how we pay attention, to observing the tolerances of a material/system to find exploitable patterns. Classes will develop hard skills such as origami, the manipulation of the 2D manifold itself, and weaving, as a historical reflection on computation.

The class meets 5 times between March 14th and April 11th.

### March 14 - Digital ↔ Analog Translation

- What is computational/digital? What is material/analog?
- Patterns, Flowcharts
- Walking tour
- Translations
- Conditional design drawing
- Programmed physical systems)
- Prep Class 4

### March 21 - Origami Design

- history and basic origami vocabulary
- hands-on exercise: simple folds
- box pleating: 3D letters, bugs
- origami design methods: circle + rivers
- computational origami: origami theorems
- origami tessellations: metamaterials, miura ori
- design activity: origami tessellations

### March 28 - Weaving to the Moon

- Discussion: Looms, Woven ledgers, Tzolkin, Liminality, Quantum computing
- Core memory and NASA
- How does core memory Work?
- Demo: Switching the polarity of a single ferrite core, sending voltage to a core
- Demo: How to read from a core, read rows, read 4
- Workshop: Weaving ferrite cores, encoding secret messages

### April 4 - Material Affordances

- Volvelles and paper calculators (10 min with Kelli)
- Functional Pop-up books (10 min with Kelli)
- Material affordances of paper
- Mechanically-programmed movements
- Punch cards, jacquard looms
- Material Show + Tell

### April 11 - Material Applications

- handmade computer
